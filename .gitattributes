# Set the default behavior, in case people don't have core.autocrlf set.
* text=lf

# Explicitly declare text files you want to always be normalized and converted
# to native line endings on checkout.
*.c text
*.h text

# Declare files that will always have CRLF line endings on checkout.
*.sln text eol=crlf

# Denote all files that are truly binary and should not be modified.
*.png binary
*.jpg binary


# You'll notice that files are matched— *.c, *.sln, *.png—, separated by a space,
# then given a setting—text, text eol=crlf, binary. We'll go over some possible settings below.

# text=auto
# Git will handle the files in whatever way it thinks is best. This is a good default option.

# text eol=crlf
# Git will always convert line endings to CRLF on checkout.
# You should use this for files that must keep CRLF endings, even on OSX or Linux.

# text eol=lf
# Git will always convert line endings to LF on checkout. You should use this for files that must keep LF endings, even on Windows.

# binary
# Git will understand that the files specified are not text, and it should not try to change them.
# The binary setting is also an alias for -text -diff.
